#  MyChef — Recipe Website/Dashbord

**MyChef** is a fun and simple recipe website I built using just **HTML and CSS**. The idea was to create a clean, easy-to-navigate space where users can explore different meal categories, view some popular dishes, and check out their full recipes.

##  Features I've Worked On

 A clean, responsive **homepage** with a hero section and featured recipes  
 A **sidebar** that lets users navigate easily between:  
- Breakfast  
- Lunch  
- Dinner  
- Dessert  
- Drinks  

 Each category has its own page showing **3 popular meals** using neat recipe cards  
 A **"View Recipe"** button that leads to detailed pages for each meal *(currently working on finishing all of them)*  
 Each **recipe detail page** shows:
- An image of the dish  
- Ingredients list  
- Step-by-step instructions

##  What I’ve Learned While Building This

This project taught me a lot! Some key things I’ve picked up along the way:

-  How to structure a full website with multiple pages and organized folders  
-  Creating layouts that can be reused across pages  
-  Styling everything nicely using **Flexbox**  
-  Linking between pages using **relative paths** (this helped a lot!)  
-  Writing clean, semantic HTML and keeping my CSS separate  
-  Using **real recipe content** to make the site feel more complete and real

##  Pages I’ve Built So Far

- `index.html` – Main homepage  
- `sidebar/breakfast.html`, `sidebar/lunch.html`, etc. for each category  
- `recipes/scrambled-eggs.html`, `recipes/zobo.html`, `recipes/chocolate-cake.html` — full recipe pages  
- Custom CSS for categories and recipes

This was a really fun project to build. It helped me understand how everything ties together—from layout and content to structure and design. Still working on adding the rest of the recipe pages, but I’m super proud of how far it’s come!
